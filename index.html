                Chess Cheating with AI, Sept 2024 - 
                <br>
                I am interested in understanding the relationships between time spent on moves and what the moves end up being. I am using open data from <a href="https://database.lichess.org/">lichess.org</a> and currently am doing some statistical analysis about the time spent on each move and other features of the games. (One example is how the distribution of time spent differs foe moves that ended up being blunders and moves that were not.) I am working on this project with <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/">NYU CIMS Professor Fernandez-Granda</a>. This project is for the data science class Independent Research.

                <br>
                We were interested in using Python and PowerBI to analyze and visualize the correlation between a neighborhood's income in NYC and the average EMS response. We were wondering if there was a significant correlation, which we tested for and verified with an $\alpha = 0.05$. I cleaned the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/EMS-Incident-Dispatch-Data/76xm-jjuj/about_data">dataset</a>, which can be found on the NYC Open Data Catalog, and used PowerBI to create a dashboard that helped visualize the data. This was a personal interest project between myself and a friend.

        <h2>Math & Problem Solving</h2>

        <p>
            To me, math is an attempt to make sense of our understanding of the world and the weird things that happen in it. I was on the Stuyvesant Math Team in all four years of high school and on the NYC Math Team for three years. In my final year, I was an Assistant Captain and a finalist in the 2021* Princeton University Math Competition. In college, I have taken the Putnam exam every year - my high score is 23!
        </p>

        <p>
            I am a writer for both the NYCIML contest and the mathleague.org contest series. While in high school, I felt stronger with combinatorics (combo) and probability, my experience writing and editing questions have made me more well-rounded and have caught my skills up in the other sectors (algebra, number theory, and geometry) as well. Some of my sample questions can be found below, in no particular order. Have fun!

                Expected Value <br>Audrey has a spinner with three equal parts, one red, one green, and one blue. She also has a fair coin. She spins the spinner to start a game. If she lands on red, the game is done. If she lands on green, she flips the coin once. If she lands on yellow, she spins the spinner again. If she flips the coin and she lands on heads, she spins the spinner once. If she flips the coin and she lands on tails, the game is done. On average, how many times will she flip the coin before the game is done?
                <br>
                <button onclick="toggleSolution('audrey')">Toggle Solution</button>
                <div class="solution" id="solution-audrey" style="display:none;">
                    The spinner has three sections, but because if she lands on yellow she will just spin the spinner again, it effectively only has two sections, green and red, and these two sections occur with equal probability. In order for her to finish the game without flipping the coin at all, she must have landed on red, which occurs with probability $\frac{1}{2}$. Otherwise, she flips the coin at least once. If she flips the coin exactly once before the game ends, then she must have landed on green, then either flipped tails or flipped heads followed by another spin on red. The probability she flips tails from the very beginning is $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$, while the probability that she flips heads and then lands on red is $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}$. This means the probability she flips the coin exactly once is $\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}$. Notice that when she flips the coin, the future outcomes are independent of what has already occurred. This means that in the remaining probability that she gets to flip the coin a second time, which occurs with probability $1 - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{8} = \frac{1}{8}$, the chance she will flip the coin a third time is going to be $\frac{1}{4}$ of the time, since at this point $\frac{1}{2}$ of the time she will flip tails and end the game, and $\frac{1}{4}$ of the time she will flip heads and then spin red. Then her weighted probability of the number of times she will flip the coin is $0 \times \frac{1}{2} + 1 \times \frac{3}{8} + 2 \times \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} + 3 \times \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{4} + \cdots$. This can be simplified as $\frac{3}{8} \times \left( 1 + 2 \times \frac{1}{4} + 3 \times \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{4} + \cdots \right)$. This inner sum can be considered as $\left(1+\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{4} + \cdots \right) + \left(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{4} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{4} + \cdots \right) + \cdots$. The first geometric series is equal to $1 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{16} + \cdots = \frac{4}{3}$, while each after that is $\frac{1}{4}$ the value. This means the infinite sum is $\frac{4}{3} + \frac{4}{3} \times \frac{1}{4} + \frac{4}{3} \times \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{4} + \cdots = \frac{4}{3} \times \frac{4}{3}$, which is $\frac{16}{9}$. Therefore, the number of times she will flip the coin on average is $\frac{3}{8} \times \frac{16}{9} = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.

                Let $O$ be the center of regular hexagon $ABCDEF$, and let $P$ be a randomly selected point inside $ABCDEF$. What is the probability that $P$ is closer to $A$ than it is to any of $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, $F$, or $O$?
                <br>
                <button onclick="toggleSolution('hexagon')">Toggle Solution</button>
                <div class="solution" id="solution-hexagon" style="display:none;">
                    Draw a line perpendicular to $AB$ and halfway between $A$ and $B$, through $O$, as shown below. The points closer to $A$ than to $B$ are on the same side of this line as $A$. Similarly, the points closer to $A$ than to $F$ are on the top side of the line halfway between $AF$. Since this is a regular hexagon, $OBA$ is an equilateral triangle; so the line halfway between $O$ and $A$ is the height from $B$, which is $BF$. Since $OCB$ and $OAB$ are congruent triangles, the line halfway between $A$ and $C$ is $OB$, and the line halfway between $A$ and $E$ is $OF$. Finally, the line halfway between $A$ and $D$ is the vertical line through $O$. None of these $3$ lines affect the area which is closer to $A$ than to any other vertex, shown by the shaded region below. Now, consider triangle $OBA$. It can be divided into $6$ equal regions, as shown by the dotted lines. Of these, $2$ lie within the shaded region. Another $2$ triangles of the same size make up the rest of the shaded region, below $OA$. The hexagon contains a total of $6 \cdot 6 = 36$ such triangles, so the desired region is $\frac{4}{36}$ of the hexagon, or $\boxed{\frac{1}{9}}$.

            <li> Combo <br>
                Bob has $10$ baskets numbered $1$ to $10$. Given that the $n$th basket has $n$ distinct fruits in it, compute the number of ways for Bob to choose two fruits from different baskets.
                <br>

                <div class="solution" id="solution-bob" style="display:none;">
                    The total number of pairs of fruits is $\binom{55}{2}$ because there are $1+2+\cdots+10=55$ fruits. The number of pairs of fruits in the $n$th basket is $\binom{n}{2}$. So, the number of pairs of fruits from different baskets is $\binom{55}{2} - \binom{1}{2} - \binom{2}{2} - \cdots - \binom{10}{2}$. By the Hockey Stick Identity, this simplifies to $\binom{55}{2} - \binom{11}{3} = \frac{55 \cdot 54}{2 \cdot 1} - \frac{11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}$. This simplifies to $55 \cdot 27 - 11 \cdot 5 \cdot 3 = 11(135 - 15) = \boxed{1320}$.

            <li>Game Theory <br>
                There are $10$ cards on a table numbered with the whole numbers from $1$ to $10$, inclusive. Troy and Ben then play a game with these cards, with Troy going first. With the numbers showing, they take turns removing one card at a time until there are two cards left on the table. In addition, Troy wants to minimize the difference between the numbers on the last two cards, and Ben wants to maximize the difference between the numbers on the last two cards. Given that both players will always play to maximize their ability to achieve their own goals, what will the positive difference between the numbers on the last two cards be?
                <br>
                <button onclick="toggleSolution('cards')">Toggle Solution</button>
                <div class="solution" id="solution-cards" style="display:none;">
                    Troy is trying to minimize the difference between the last two numbers showing, so he can guarantee a difference of no more than $5$ by removing the four largest or the four smallest numbers from the table. Now consider Ben's strategy. To ensure that the difference between the final two numbers will take its maximum value of $5$, he can pair cards with numbers that have a positive difference of $5$. Regardless of which card Troy removes, Ben will always remove the other card in that pair, so the last two cards on the table must be one of those pairs. Thus, since Troy can guarantee a positive difference of no more than $5$ and Ben can guarantee a positive difference of no less than $5$, the numbers on the two final cards will always have a positive difference of $\boxed{5}$.
                </div>

            <li> Number Theory <br>
                Compute the smallest positive whole number that yields a remainder of $5$ when divided by $7$, a remainder of $7$ when divided by $11$, and a remainder of $11$ when divided by $13$.
                <br>
                <button onclick="toggleSolution('crt')">Toggle Solution</button>
                <div class="solution" id="solution-crt" style="display:none;">
                    Let $n$ be the smallest such number. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $n \le 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 = 1001$. Since $n$ leaves a remainder of $5$ when divided by $7$ and a remainder of $11$ when divided by $13$, it stands to be the case that $n+2$ is divisible by both $7$ and $13$, so $n+2$ is a multiple of $91$. However, $n$ leaves a remainder of $7$ when divided by $11$, so $n+4$ is a multiple of $11$. Thus, $n+4$ is a multiple of $11$ that is $2$ greater than a multiple of $91$. Since $91$ leaves a remainder of $3$ when divided by $11$, $91 \cdot 3$ leaves a remainder of $9$ when divided by $11$. Thus, $n+2 = 91 \cdot 3$, which is $273$, and $n+4 = 275$, which is $11 \cdot 25$. Therefore, $n = \boxed{271}$.

            <li> Probability <br>
                Kayla the frog is hopping between lily pads arranged in a $3 \times 3$ grid pattern. She starts on the center lily pad and makes $10$ jumps, each time to a random lily pad that is adjacent to the one she is currently on. Compute the probability that after $10$ jumps, she returns to the center lily pad.
                <br>
                <button onclick="toggleSolution('')">Toggle Solution</button>
                <div class="solution" id="solution-" style="display:none;">
                    Notice that no matter which direction Kayla jumps to after her first jump, the grid can be rotated such that she ends up on the middle lily pad in the top row. Thus, by radial symmetry, the four lily pads that are adjacent to the center yield symmetrical cases. Furthermore, notice that after every other jump, Kayla will end up on one of these four lily pads, since the grid can be painted with an alternating checkerboard pattern that forces Kayla to switch the color she stands on with each jump. Combining these two points indicates that after her ninth jump, she will be on one of these four lily pads, and without loss of generality, it can be assumed that she is on the middle lily pad in the top row. Then she has $3$ choices for her tenth jump, one of which lands her on the center lily pad. The desired probability is $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

            <li> 3D Geometry <br>
                Every face of a right square pyramid has an area of 64 square meters. The volume of the pyramid can be expressed in the form $\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}$ cubic meters, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, $b$ is not divisible by the square of a prime, and $a$ and $c$ are relatively prime. Compute $a+b+c$.
                <br>
                <button onclick="toggleSolution('pyramid')">Toggle Solution</button>
                <div class="solution" id="solution-pyramid" style="display:none;">
                    The base of the pyramid is a square whose area is 64 square meters, so the side length of the square base is 8 meters. Each of the triangular faces of the pyramid also has an area of 64 square meters, so the height of each triangle is $64 \cdot 2 \div 8 = 16$ meters. This is the distance from the apex, which is the vertex of the pyramid not in the square base, to the midpoint of one side of the square. This is also called the slant height of the pyramid. The center of the base forms a right triangle with the apex and this midpoint. The distance between the center of the base and the midpoint is half the side length of the square, so this distance is $8 \div 2 = 4$ meters. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the height of the pyramid, which is the distance from the apex to the center of the base, is $\sqrt{256-16} = 4\sqrt{15}$ meters. Therefore, the volume is $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 4\sqrt{15} \cdot 8 = \frac{32\sqrt{15}}{3}$ cubic meters, so $a+b+c = 32+15+3$, or $\boxed{50}$.

            <li> Probability <br>
                Noel rolls a fair, standard six-sided die until he rolls the same number two times in a row. What is the probability that he will roll the die four or fewer times?
                <br>
                <button onclick="toggleSolution('noel')">Toggle Solution</button>
                <div class="solution" id="solution-noel" style="display:none;">
                    Rolling the die four times is equivalent to having three chances of rolling the same number. On each of these three chances, the probability that he rolls the same number is $\frac{1}{6}$, so the probability that he does not roll the same number on any particular roll is $\frac{5}{6}$. Then the probability that for all three chances, he does not roll the same number is $\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^3 = \boxed{\frac{125}{216}}$.

        <p><em>A mathematician who is not also something of a poet will never be a complete mathematician. - Karl Weierstrass</em></p>
        <p>While I am not exactly a poet, I am also interested in animation. In fact, it was my and my friends' shared passion for animation that led us to work on EnLiven Animation in 2021. Working on actual animation projects since then has led me to develop better organizational and planning skills for my programming projects above. For example, through my most recently completed animation, I learned the importance of the 80/20 rule. Thanks to logging my time from the very beginning, I saw how I spent about 75% of my time on the project making minor adjustments and adding small details and easter eggs, getting the project from good to nearly perfect.</p>

            I am also a big fan of puzzles. Growing up with Sudokus, I quickly loved how KenKens managed to incorporate the logic of Sudokus with basic arithmetic to create a new type of puzzle. In high school, I created the Condiment KenKen series for my school's math newsletter, the <a href="https://stuymathsurvey.com/">Stuy Math Survey</a>. Of the ones I submitted, the two below are available on their website.

            </a></li>
            I also became the editor of the Puzzles department, overseeing and editing the puzzles submitted by my fellow peers.

            For a quick brain teaser on the train, I enjoy challenging myself with Set, a fast-paced card game that uses four different variables to encode information. I use the app in the App Store below. My one-minute record is 23 sets!
